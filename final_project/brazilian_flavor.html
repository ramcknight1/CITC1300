            <p>Discover the savory delight of grilled Picanha, a uniquely Brazilian cut of steak from the rump cap muscle, offering a tender and flavorful dining experience. Also known as culotte, top sirloin cap, or rump cover, this triangular cut boasts versatility and robust flavor. Begin by salting the picanha up to 24 hours in advance, allowing the flavors to penetrate and enhance the meat's texture. When ready to grill, employ the reverse sear method by slowly cooking the picanha over low heat until it reaches an internal temperature of 115°F, ensuring a juicy and tender outcome. Then, sear the steak over medium-high heat for a brief period on each side until it reaches 130°F, achieving a perfect medium-rare finish. While resting the meat is optional, it allows the flavors to meld and intensify, further enhancing your dining experience. With its succulent texture and mouthwatering flavor, grilled Picanha is sure to elevate any barbecue or dinner gathering to new heights of culinary excellence.</p>
