        <h2>What You Will Need for Indoor Giant Dogs:</h2>
        <p>Giant breed dogs take up a lot of space in your house, and as their breed size suggests; they can create some giant messes as well.  Newfies in particular have lots of fur, love to find/create mud puddles in your yard, and if given the chance take pride in making a mess around their water bowls.  Changing a few aspects of your home and buying a few products are a must if you hope to maintain a somewhat clean house, but the lovable natures Newfies bring to your home make it all worth it.  Over the past year of many trials and error; we have come to find several life hacks and must have products that help make your house a comfortable home for both you and your Newfies.  Many of our discoveries we think would benefit any dog breeds, not just the giant ones.  We've compiled a list of our favorite finds on Amazon that simply make life easier and little bit less messy when living with giant breed doggos.</p>

        <h3>Outfitting Your Home for Giant Breed Dogs:</h3>
        <p>In addition to the products above, there are several other considererations to keep in mind when it comes to floor care and air quality.  For vaccuuming floors we highly suggest a strong shop vac with car detailing tips.  Newfies leave behind lots of hair and create lots of dust, especially if your yard gets muddy when it rains; Newfie fur dries quickly and releases any outdoor dirt easily, which means whatever dirt and mud they find outside will eventually travel indoors with them to your floors.  Along with the shopvac, we recommend getting a Swiffer with disposbale wet mop heads.  Newfies get hot even indoors with their thick coats, so indoor fans pointed towards their beds is ideal.  As far as air quality goes, we have found that when using fans, it's best to have filters on the intakes; this keeps the fans from blowing dirt or dust around in between floor sweeps.  Air Scrubbers work great for both filtering your home's air as well as keeping a constant breeze on your dog beds.</p>
