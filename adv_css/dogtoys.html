        <h2>Best Chew Toys For Your Newfie</h2>
        <p>Newfies, like most dogs, love to chew, especially puppies.  We found that having multiple textures for our dogs to chew on works best.  The benebone hard chew bone is a hard texture that is designed to mimic a wooden stick but without the splintering and mess that an actual stick creates.  Next the hard rubber Kong brand toy with hollow center is great for all around chewing, especially for teething puppies.  Lastly, Newfies gravitate towards soft toys the most since they tend to naturally have soft palletes; the Kong Knot Bear had a hard rope skeleton that increases it's lifespan and gives Newfies a durable soft chewtoy.  However, the Kong bear will give out after 4-6 months though due to it's softer components and the chew power of Newfies.  We highly recommend getting all 3 of these chew toys for Newfies.</p>

        <h2>Best Play Toys For Your Newfie</h2>
        <p>Newfies are thought to be low energy dogs, and this can be true in their adult years, but just like other breeds, they have puppy energy.  Tennis balls are one of their favorites and listed below is a cheap bundle of blue tennis balls that are less than $1.50 a ball on Amazon.  We try and choose as many of their toys in the color blue because when given the choice, our dogs always gravitate towards toys that are blue.  It's a common misconception that dogs can only see black and white, but in reality they can see limited shades of blue, yellow, and brown in addition to the typical grayscale.  So naturally, blue toys stand out to dogs, and with our Newfies blue is fan favorite.  Lastly, the absolute favorite toy for our Newfies are hand puppets; their breed tends to be mouthy, so when there is a toy that allows them to mouth your hand, they are all about it.</p>
